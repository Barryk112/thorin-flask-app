    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he
                and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he
                quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
                TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
                shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which would remain with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            
                As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they
                that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.
            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
            
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
            
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was
                captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a
                fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member
                of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the
                Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in
                the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

                Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori, travelled with Bilbo Baggins
                and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on theQuest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from
                the dragon Smaug.
            
                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
                well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore
                a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen
                companions.

                shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in
                the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

                between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years,"
                and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA
                2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the

            <h3>Bilbo</h3>
            <p>
                Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890
                of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
            
                In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag
                End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
            
                As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took
                interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's
                firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his
                rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a
                rock.
            
                When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the
                next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and
                acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music
                of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became
                one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like
                Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but
                walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them
                wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of
                Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
            
                When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who
                opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the five to be sent. At first, Olórin was
                nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told Olórin that such was a
                reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of Sauron's power,
                presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manwë insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him
                to send Olórin as the second instead. He agreed, and prepared for Olórin's departure from the Undying Lands with
                the other four, arriving about the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.
